eventapp readme
---------------

currently there is no name for this app. it will be decided before the app goes live. i know this readme sucks, but when you're having too much fun writing software, you aren't writing readme's.

dependencies - things you need to make the beast run
----------------------------------------------------

should run with latest ruby and rails.

install postgresql on your machine: google it.

install thinking sphinx on your machine: google it.

there are a lot more dependencies, please feel free to add.


instructions
------------

clone the project. 

install the dependencies.

install all the gem dependencies:

$ bundle install

migrate the db: 

$ rake db:migrate

put some fake data into the app:

$ rake db:populate

i probably forgot something so add it.
